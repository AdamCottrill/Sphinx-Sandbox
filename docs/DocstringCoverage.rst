==================
DocString Coverage
==================

Coverage can be provided by a coverage extension too...

Coverage is provided by the ``sphinx.ext.coverage`` extension.  Add the
``sphinx.ext.coverage`` to you list of extensions and then execute the command:

.. code:: shell

  > sphinx-build -b coverage . _build/coverage


The coverage module can be integrated into a continuous build process to ensure
that documentation is always included with new code as it is created.


.. note::

  Fill this section in some time soon...
