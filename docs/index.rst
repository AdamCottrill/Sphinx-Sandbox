   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to My Sphinx Sandbox!
==============================================


This document was developed to explore many of the features available
in the Sphinx documentation system and provide more easily accessible
examples of features I use most often.  It was originally developed
from the Sphinx tutorial presented at 2021 pycon, but was expanded to
include additional functionality and worked examples.  Consider this a
living document.

*todo* Replace My_Aquarium Python code with my own code some day...
